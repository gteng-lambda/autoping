# autoping
This is a begginer project that I wanted to work on in order to get my metaphorical "foot in the door" with software/scripting

AutoPing project for network logging and displaying successes and faults to a csv.

This project uses the os package and the datetime package.

The goal of this project was to write a log with a date and a time to track when the packages. When the network goes down it will display when
the network went down. 

This program will write two files:

"pingtest.txt"

and 

"ping_report.csv"

(Feel free to change these names)

Also, it is a good idea to make a driectory for these files using the mkdir command and then placing the file into it.

This project also utilizes command line tools to create files and execute files with the os.system method.

Please read the script fully before running it and make changes as you see it be necessary.

Feel free to reach out via GitHub comments and/or emailing me at: gtengler@proton.me
